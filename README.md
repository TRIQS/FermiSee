 # triqs valley_tools
 
 This is a graphical A(k,w) analyzer build on triqs thight binding models decorated with a self-energy.

 To run the example do 
 ```
 python example_dash.py
 ```

* should we try to avoid using triqs, to make installation easier? 
* decide on h5 data structure
    * are we using tb_lattice to interpolate k meshes on the fly?

## ToDo list:
