 # triqs_spectrometer
 
 This is a graphical A(k,w) analyzer tool, based on triqs/lattice/tight_binding-models decorated with a self-energy. 
 
 This tool uses the dash library (dash.plotly.com) to export plotly figures interactively to html.

 To run the tool execute locally:
 ```
 python app.py
 ```

## questions:
* should we try to avoid using triqs to make installation easier? 
* decide on h5 data structure
    * are we using tb_lattice to interpolate k meshes on the fly?

## ToDo list:
